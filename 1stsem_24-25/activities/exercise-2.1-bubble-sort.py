#Convert each string element to a reference character, often the first character of the string.
#Compare the Unicode value of these reference characters to decide the order of the two strings.
#Swap the strings if they are found in the incorrect order based on their reference characters.
#Iterate through the list of strings, repeatedly sorting and swapping until the entire list is arranged in alphabetical order.


#output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'grape', 'orange']
